# api-radar

`api-radar` is a health monitoring tool for apis built using Express.js applications designed to collect API endpoints automatically. It is the first step in building an API health monitoring system, where collected API data can be sent to a backend service for further testing and monitoring.

## Features

- Automatically collects and logs API endpoints in an Express.js application.
- Handles routes registered directly on the app and nested routes using routers.
- Designed for future integration with backend services for API health monitoring.
